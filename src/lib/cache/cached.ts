/**
 * Wraps `unstable_cache` with the tag taxonomy so every cached helper
 * in the app shares one vocabulary. `keyParts` distinguishes cache
 * entries; `tags` determine invalidation; `revalidate` is the ceiling
 * in seconds.
 *
 * Serialisation: unstable_cache stringifies the function's arguments
 * when keying, so every argument the wrapped function takes must be
 * deterministically serialisable (string, number, bool, etc). Passing
 * a Supabase client directly is NOT safe — wrap helpers that need a
 * client using the factory-per-call pattern (cachedQuery inside a
 * thin outer function that constructs the client on cache miss).
 *
 * Authorisation: cache entries are shared across users, so cached
 * helpers must not depend on the caller's auth cookies. The pattern
 * used in queries.ts is to construct a service-role client inside the
 * cached body (createCachedContextClient) — authorisation happens at
 * the page level BEFORE the cached call, via requireAuth /
 * requireGymAdmin / is_gym_member on the app side.
